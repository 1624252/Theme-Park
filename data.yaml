      The ride begins inside the missile. The countdown will begin, and a clip of the warships will be prepared.
      Then, the missile will be launched at extreme speeds and end with a screen saying, “What would result of this
      world if the nukes were launched”. The characters of Kennedy and Khruschev would then negotiate for a heartfelt
      message. The Cuban Missile Crisis action would have turned the Cold War into a hot nuclear war because of the
      threat of mutually assured destruction. The leaders of the two superpowers—Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and
      President Kennedy—were able to overcome the inertia of groupthink by their advisors and be calmer and cooler than
      everyone around them to prevent a catastrophe.

      This ride is based on the Berlin Airlift. It features a roller coaster ride with shuttles that resemble C-47 and
      C-54 aircraft to mimic the military planes used during the Berlin Airlift. The user will ride in the plane and
      pretend to be a supply drop. Then, through random chance, they will be launched down to “Berlin” to fuel the
      people in order to further support the containment policy of the US. During the Berlin Airlift, the U.S. and U.K.
      delivered more than 2.3 million tons of food, fuel and supplies to West Berlin via more than 278,000 airdrops.
      American aircrews made more than 189,000 flights, totaling nearly 600,000 flying hours and exceeding 92 million miles.

      Guests must traverse a war-torn land in the jungle of Vietnam. Workers dressed as military personnel in hazmat
      suits and war-hardened survivors will jump at the guest as they progress through the roller coaster ride and shoot
      down the guest (with water). The ride demonstrates the experience of soldiers in the Vietnam War as well as how
      easy it was to die to the guerilla warfare tactics of the Viet Cong. The jungle shows how well-hidden enemies were
      and how indirect the bloodshed that occurred was during the Vietnam War.

      A dropping attraction meant to represent a bomb rushing to the ground. Guests board the bomb and experience
      dropping from extreme heights. The operation has a narration of the mission and 3D art of the visual destruction.
      The goal of this operation is to show the damage and give firsthand experience of the Operation Rolling Thunder
      during the Vietnam War as a bomb on the plane and the mission of the operator. This shows the historic
      significance of the event as well as the damage it incurs.

      This ride shows Upton Sinclair’s “The Jungle” where the coaster is designed as a pig and the audience rides
      inside. Here, the audience journeys through various knives and unsanitary conditions of the meat packing plant
      and ends with driving through the butcher’s knife. The idea is to highlight the journey of one of the most
      prominent exposés of the progressive movement. The revelation of the unsanitary conditions of the meat packing
      plant expressed by the book is also shown in the ride. As a result, the Pure Food and Drug Act passed.

      This ride plays on the words of the expose “The Other Side” and tours through the tenement housing. The ride goes
      through the unsanitary conditions of the house, the excess dirt and dust, and zooms in to see the germs of the
      housing. The ride ends with a screen asking if it is just to allow treatment like this. This is historically
      relevant as the expose is important to the time period. While in the past, the conditions of immigrants were
      ignored to the extravagance of the rich, the expose shows the harmful effects of poverty similar to the ride,
      leading to awareness in the riders similar to how the expose brought awareness to American Society.

      The riders spin around in an upside-down Hooverville tent. It is designed using the centripetal force to keep the
      members on the walls. With the majority of those in Hoovervilles being in debt and only a few escaping it, we made
      it so that the last person to fall is the only one who doesn’t “drown” in debt. The floor is covered in banknotes
      of debt to symbolize the poverty of the great depression. The Great Depression is characterized by poverty and
      debt. With a rush on banks occurring to take money out, many citizens are left in debt. With even fewer jobs being
      available, the ride is designed to simulate the harshness of obtaining success and money in harsh times of recession.

      Ride on some horses and carry your laser gun. Shoot the dollar bills in the bank rush that fly by in order to get
      out of 10,000 dollars of debt. The twist is that some fly by dollars are actually bank notes of more debt. The
      rush on banks occurred during the Great Depression. The ride symbolizes the grab for money. The shooting of the
      money displays random chance of getting money out or not. The end result is a historic situation. With the
      difficulty of the ride and members already in debt in losing much of their money, most of the riders will stay in
      debt at the end of the coaster ride.

      Ride the pig roller coaster over the bay and shoot the Cubans before they shoot you. The goal above all is
      survival. The Bay of Pigs was a massacre and failure on JFK’s part and thus has a high danger rating. With enemies
      surrounding the riders, it will prove difficult to make it out the ride alive. The goal of the ride is to show the
      flaws of the Bay of Pigs and difficulties of war and bloodshed. Its historical relevance presides in its
      connection with the Bay of Pigs, which occurred under JFK’s presidency and supervision. His order of the Bay of
      Pigs proved a failure and, like the ride, had a high mortality rate.

      Use the peace guns and shoot your peace to nearby countries and spread the food, wealth, or shoot at trash nearby
      to earn points. The winner with the most points gets a peacemaker badge. The gun symbolizes the ways that the
      volunteers of the peace corps helped developing countries in need. During JFK’s presidency, many developing
      countries currently suffered from a lack of food and water as well as money. The Peace Corps was created to get
      the younger generation involved in helping foreign countries and volunteering. This ride holds historic relevance
      in its direct connection to JFK’s presidency and the Peace Corps being overseen by him in how the riders, like
      the Peace Corps, solved the problems faced by developing countries.

    name: Capitalism Candy Bill
    image: placeholder-smaller.gif
    location: [500, 277]
    description: >
      On it, the candy bill says, “The Taste of Freedom”. Has Truman’s face on it to show that he endorses this ideology
      and uses the bill as a form of propaganda. It holds relevance in taking form some of the various forms of
      propaganda common during this time historically. The US during the Cold War used much propaganda from speeches to
      posters against the communist. The bill talking of freedom is an example of another form of propaganda for capitalism.

      Designed in introducing his own philosophy of fighting communist ideology to the amusement park workers. The clothing will be the common motif of the American flag for the suit and navy-blue pants. The shoes are black and customary to the time. His face is consistent with Harry Truman’s face. 
      
      Interaction- The interaction comes at the Cold War section of the theme park. Here, Truman aims to convince the audience to join the capitalist side of America against the communist. He interacts by talking bad of communism and actively engages with the audience to get them to join America.
      
      The significance of Truman is that he is responsible for the first events starting the Cold War. His policy of containment started the tension between the Soviets and the US. He created the hydrogen bomb and initiated the Marshall plan to bail Europe out of debt and keep them capitalist. He also initiated the berlin airlift, a success for the capitalist ideology in overriding the blockade by the communists.

      Does other rides such as the Cuban missile crisis to show the mediation at the end. His teeth are really white as a symbol of media. He wears a classic black suit and red tie. While against communism, he is the mediator of ideologies after the Cuban missile crisis. Therefore, a simple US flag pin and an olive branch to symbolize peace suits him at the end. 
      
      Interaction- He interacts by starting off completely against communism like Truman. He speaks of the flaws in communism and why it is necessary for America to get involved and battle communism through proxy wars. He actively suggests the audience join his alliance. Over time, he changes at the end and becomes more accepting of communism’s existence after the Cuban Missile crisis ride. This shows a message of unity to the audience and ends with a good message. 
      
      The significance of this character historically is that President Kennedy initiated much of the foreign policy against communism. His foreign policy was the peace corps to help developing countries and develop relations. He also committed the Bay of Pigs which was aimed to end communism in Cuba but failed ultimately. Finally, there was the Cuban Missile Crisis as the first form of major tension and mediation. It resulted in a form of coexistence between the ideologies and a red line from the US to Russia.

      Interaction- The character interacts with the audience by ordering them and forcing them into the communist side during the park of the cold war. This adds for a way to get the experience of the Communist side of the Cuban missile crisis. In addition, the character preaches for communism throughout the park as a way to stay in character. 
      
      Significance- Stalin was the first communist Cold War leader. He participated in WW2 and earned much land as well as spread communism to other countries. In addition, he was revered by the Marxist as a hero of the working class due to his ideals. He also killed many with his policies and ended political rivals.
